Introduction

Welcome to our project! We (Bahar, Timo and Anto) have built this project to analyze mobility on different levels:

1. We compare German mobility with other european countries' mobility.
2. We compare German mobility on state level and on pre-specified divisions of Germany such as "City-States vs Non-City-States" and "Former BRD vs DDR".
3. We analyze whether there is "Lockdown fatigue" in Germany by setting up several regressions with different specifications.
